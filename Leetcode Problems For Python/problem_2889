# to tranform the table use pivot and we can use pivot_table
import pandas as pd

def pivotTable(weather: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    return weather.pivot(index='month', columns='city', values='temperature')


# explaination

# pivot(index='month', columns='city', values='temperature')
# ðŸ“Œ Problem Restatement

# You are given a DataFrame called weather with 3 columns:

    # city â†’ name of the city
    # month â†’ name of the month
    # temperature â†’ temperature in that city during that month

# Your task: reshape the data so that:

    # Each row = one month
    # Each column = one city
    # Each cell = temperature for that cityâ€“month pair
